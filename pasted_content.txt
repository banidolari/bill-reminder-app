Simplify the Onboarding & Setup Process:
Streamline the process for adding bills. Aim for a 3–5 step setup where users can quickly enter a bill’s name, amount, due date, and reminder preferences. Removing unnecessary fields can reduce friction and improve user retention.

Enhanced Notification & Auto-Pay Features:
Consider incorporating flexible notification settings—allowing users to customize how many days in advance they receive reminders—and think about adding an optional auto-pay feature. This can help users who prefer a more automated experience while still keeping manual control for others.

Robust Expense & Budget Tracking:
Beyond reminders, integrating simple budgeting tools or expense categorization can offer added value. Providing visual summaries (like charts or calendars) can help users better understand their spending habits and plan ahead.

Modern, Trustworthy UI/UX:
Although a blue/green color scheme is a solid choice for financial apps, you might consider offering customizable themes or slight adjustments to align with your brand identity. An engaging, minimalistic design with clear hierarchy will enhance usability and trust.

Secure Authentication Options:
In addition to a basic email/password login, think about implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) or even social login options. This not only improves security but also enhances convenience for your users.
